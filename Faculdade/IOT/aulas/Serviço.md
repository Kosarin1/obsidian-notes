1) Smart parking: this area of smart city deals with
monitoring and smartly parking of vehicles in the city by
finding proper parking spaces.

2) Structural health: by monitoring the different
conditions like material conditions and amount of vibrations
of buildings, bridges, monuments, and roads, it is possible to
suggest improvements to be made well on time [28].

3) Smart noise handling: Sound monitoring can be
done to prevent any type of mishappening in the bar area and
crowded zones in real time. For intelligent monitoring of
vehicle noise in the smart environment of IoT, a system is
proposed in [29].

4) Smart traffic management: Monitoring of vehicles
and congestion on any route can be used to suggest and
optimize driving and walking routes at a real time.

5) Smart waste management: Trash collection routes
can be optimized by detecting levels of waste in different
containers. Furthermore when smart waste management is
combined with smart traffic management then routes can be
suggested to the waste container vehicles for the collection of
waste, according to the level of wastes and traffic congestion.

6) Smart lighting: Turning on/off street lights according
to the weather conditions and requirements (whenever a
vehicle pass through the way) results in saving a huge amount
of energy. This intelligent and adaptive lightning issuccessfully implemented by various researchers in this area
both on roads and at homes.

7) Smart roads: highways can be made smart highways
or intelligent highways when timely warning messages and
routes can be given according to climate conditions and
unexpected events such as traffic congestion or accidents or
catastrophic conditions.
B. Smart Environment/ Smart Earth
When sensors are used in monitoring environmental
conditions then it adds to the development of the country to a
great extent. Worldwide, earth monitoring is gaining interest
and is challenging too. This is all because of the harsh
operating conditions and high deployment and maintenance
difficulty level [30]. Some such applications of sensors in
creating smart environment are discussed in the following
section:

1) Forest fire detection: Alert zones can be defined and
warnings can be given on time when sensors monitor the
preemptive fire conditions and combustion gases.
2) Air pollution: Sensors can be used to monitor and
control the emissions of harmful and toxic gases of factories
and vehicles. This, if handled timely can protect the
environment to a great extent. Some such applications in this
area are given by researchers in [30].
3) Catastrophic early detection: Monitoring earth
vibrations, density, moisture in the soil, and etc., it is possible
to identify danger well on time for any landslide or
earthquake.
C. Smart Water
Monitoring water quality, it's ground level, pollution level
and any sort of leakages in containers can save water. Some
such smart sensors can be used for applications in the proper
management of the water [31].
1) Water leakages: For this water pressure can be
measured on outside tanks and pipes so that timely leakages
can be protected.
2) Controlling pollution level of the sea: Additions of
harmful or any sort of leakages or wastes to the sea can be
monitored through sensors to prevent the sea water.
3) Smart swimming pool: The conditions of a
swimming pool can be monitored through sensors and timely
management can be carried out in this direction.
4) River floods: Monitoring the level of water and its
variations from time to time in rivers, dams and reservoirs is
essentially an important task.
D. Smart Metering
Meters can be used to smartly monitor different
parameters of things in IoT like energy consumption; water,
oil or gas level; silos stock calculation and solar energy plants.
By monitoring different parameters and controlling according
enhances the performance to a great extent. Various
researchers in this area have developed systems which use
sensors to monitor day to day life things [32].


E. Smart Security:
Sensors can be deployed in various areas to ensure
security in the surroundings. Some such applications where
sensors play a major role in providing security is discussed in
the following section:
1) Smart Perimeter Access Control: A smart perimeter
around some specific areas can be made with sensors and
alarms can be implemented to alert the entry of non-authorized
people in restricted areas. An intelligent intrusion system
attached at door, named ADXL 345 accelerometer is designed
by the authors in [31].
2) Smart explosive detection: Detection of harmful gas
levels, radiation levels, and leakages can be done smartly with
the use of sensors. Sensors can be attached to the walls or
containers at factories, mines, and industries where there is a
danger of any leakage exists.
F. Smart Retail
Monitoring and controlling stocks, purchases, payments
and etc. in retail industry can also be done with the help of
sensors. The intelligent advice and suggestions can be given
in the shopping according to the choices, habits, preferences
and other contributing factors of every customer [32].
G. Smart Transport
Quality of shipping conditions can be improved by
monitoring the amount of vibrations and strokes. Items can be
traced easily using GPS like systems [28].
H. Smart Agriculture
Sensors are widely used in numerous agriculture
applications for various purposes like detecting the amount of
moisture in the soil, monitoring climate conditions and
automatic sprinkling water and pesticides to the crop. Sensors,
when attached to the ground soil, can detect the moisture in
the soil and according to the humidity in the air and
temperature appropriate amount of watering can be done.
1) Meteorological Station Network: Sensors detect the
weather conditions in the environment and forecast the snow
falling, ice formation, rain, and drought. So proper
management can be made timely to prevent any kind of
damage to the crops. An application model is presented by the
authors in [33] which detects the humidity, moisture in soil,
rainfall, pH value of soil, temperature and seed recognition.
Another study in [34] used a drone for smart agriculture.
2) Golf Courses: The selective sprinkling in only dry
zones reduce the required amount of water. This ultimately
improves the production of fruits, vegetables and crops, and
their quality. Water sprinkling in IoT agriculture is presented
in [35], it is a case of vertical farming.
3) Compost: Intelligently sensing humidity and
temperature levels for the prevention from fungus and other
microbial contaminants is essentially an interesting area in
creating smart agriculture.
I. Smart Homes
Sensors attached to different things at home for creating
a smart environment includes intelligently switching on/off
appliances, detecting intruders, detecting the amount of
ingredients used in cooking. This is done by sending alerts and
resulting in a better lifestyle. Some applications in smart
homes are as follows:
1) Remote Control Appliances: Intelligently switching
on/off appliances make the life easy and safe by preventing
from accidents and it also saves energy.
